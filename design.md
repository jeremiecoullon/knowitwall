#Design lessons with Jon Benallick

Always start mobile first. because otherwise you might get loads
of detail which will look bad when it's small. 


Test with the shittyest browser (internet explorer) to see if there are any problems with your code.

###comment section

Have a comment section!! Use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)!! gives a reason to share ideas with other people.
and you see your comment (Rather than it being sent somewhere else!)

If there are a few comments at the bottom: it looks like people care.(You'll
see '13 comments': suddenly it seems that people care) 
It can end up sparking a debate (which is good for feedback and marketing)

It's a slight wall for people to sign up to Disqus. Though they probably wont sign up if the content is shit (which is the point). If they want to sign up then it's really easy (and Disqus is well known, easy to sign up to, and saves your username/password).

Comments also give users more of a reason to talk about the product. People also tend to remember a video partially because of comments. The comment sections is one of the reasons Youtube is such a hit.
