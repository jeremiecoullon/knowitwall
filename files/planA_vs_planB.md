- Plan A: Our current plan, namely academics write scripts and we produce them.
- Plan B: We interview academics and then provide a transcript of the interview. 

Note: we can offer both options to academics and let them choose.

#Will academics contribute?


##How they would work

###Plan A:

- Academics are able to provide scripts regularly that we can work with and make awesome (edit, record etc...)


###Plan B:

- Academics are able to be interviewed, and the result is something we can work (edit)


##How they would fuck up

###Plan A:

- Academics don't provide scripts regularly or at all because of some problem. Initially, these problems seems to be:
	-  lack of time (people seemed genuinly interested but are very busy)
	-  Don't know what to write about (a free subject can be daunting)
	-  they don't feel like they get something in return (essentially they have to write a report for free..)

###Plan B:

- Academics don't want to be interviewed at all or regularly because of some problem. These problems could be:
	- Don't like to hear their own voice/be interviewed
	- don't have the time (if this is the case than Plan A definately fails because of this problem)
- We don't get enough academics due to geography (can't  access enough universities). Though is a scalabililty problem (ie: a problem we'd be lucky to have)


#The amount of work required for us to do

##Plan A:

- chasing up academics: the one's who are willing often seem to say 'call/email me again in 3 weeks as I'm really busy right now'
- Editing the scripts the academics give us (ex: we changed quite a bit of Mehdi's)
- Recording it (nailing style, pace) and editing breathing and stuff
- Music: it took ages to get good music for the Ganymede podcast; and problem of copyright! We haven't even found good music for the Tate.. (also, music divided a lot of users)

##Plan B:

- Chasing up academics. Though it only requires setting a date to do it (which you can do in advance)
- Research before interview. Don't know how much time this would take. Though we collectivly have a good broad understanding of academia. I meet academics very regularly and ask them questions without having looked up what they do online and you can get some interesting answers out of it. As our users don't have much knowledge of the subject area we shouldn't be asking questions that are too technical. You can end up having stock interview questions (which give a common structure to all the interviews). It should informal/nice/fun for both parties: we don't need to be experts.
- Interviewing the academics (say, an hour meeting for 10,15min usable material +travel)
- Editing the completed interview. Don't know how long this would take. Depends on how good the raw audio is.. 
	- cons: might have to do a lot of editing (the academic can answert a question a second time they feel it wasn't good; though we do that already with plan A).
	- pros: Don't have to worry so much about things like breathing (as an interview is expected to have side noises)

#Benefits for the academic

##Plan A:

- Their research is presented really nicely (music, audio, animation: a documentary).
- If they enjoy writing rather than speaking then this is a perfect platform

#Plan B:

- Academics get something tangible in return: you meet them, they feel special (being interviewed), get a coffee, and a _nice conversation_ This can be more than hope of futur tutoring (which is essentially more work..). An interview isn't really work for an academic
- very low amount of work for them. They don't have to write a report/script (which can feel like work). A conversation with free coffee doesn't feel like work. 

#How to test whether plan A or B will work (or both)

##Plan A:

- Email our list of academics from survey with soundcloud link to Ganymede podcast. If they don't want to contribute/don't have the time to contribute, then *adding a website isn't going to change anything*. Their schedule isn't going to free up because of a website. Common fallacy about the internet: people thinking 'once I have a website it'll all work out'.
- If from our 40 emails we get a suitable number of replies (and actual scritps) then we're good to go!

##Plan B:

- Ask academics (especially those who said they had no time at the moment to write a script) for an interview. Prepare some interview questions before. Check that:
 	- you can actually get interviews.
	- The result is good/can be good (as with the written scripts, some of the interviews wouldn't be very good)
