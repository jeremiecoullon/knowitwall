suggested strategy for startup
==============================


#context

I had a lot of discussions with the guy who's crashing at my house (Jon Bennallick). He is a designer (specifically UX design: it's about the user experience) and has been doing this for 3 years (he's very good at it..). 
I've been really pushing with him to just help me design it and get something up (because it's taking ages!! :) ). However, he explained that design is not seperate from the business: it has to *reflect* the business model. For example, if we want to focus on users the site should reflect that; however, if our model is focused on academics it should reflect that too. 


 The idea is to understand who we aiming aim (user & academics), what kind of person they are, what we want from them etc. He is ok with designing a site and leaving it at that but he feels uncomfortable doing that if the business model has a fixable flaw (and I agree with him). 
 
##the flaw
 
The flaw is that I think it will be very difficult to get academics to contribute regularly (and even contribute as a one off!). The reason for this is not their motivation but their lack of *time*. Indeed some of our keenest friends (who are very excited by the project) answered 'sounds great! though ask me again in 3 weeks I'm really busy right now!'. Maybe they will give us a text eventually but:

- chasing up people is time-consuming for us and means we get script very unreliably.
- This is coming from our *friends* who are very excited about this. Imagine how randomers we have just met might be.

##Where does this flaw come from? namely what is the problem that we have to solve?

The problem that these academics have (which we as students do as well!) is that we don't have a lot of time. Asking them to write a short essay on any topic, although fun/great opportunity etc.., is:

- time consuming
- Still work (ie: sitting down and writing something)
- can be daunting (the topic is completely open): some of my friends thought it was cool but said 'I have no idea what to write about' even though they have lots of interesting things to say.

On top of that we're asking them to do it for free (yes I know they get exposure/recommend books/tutoring at some point...). The point is that it's still effort to do.

##"But once we get an awesome website they'll rush to us"

I believe the problem a lot of academics have is the one I described above: namely *time*. (and the academics who aren't excited about it aren't the right people to contribute anyways :) ). 

This means that **adding a nice website is not going to magically free up their schedule**.

Jon was explaining (and I can totally understand this) that he sees this again and again in his job as a designer: people who say (more or less explicitly): "once I get a website up it'll be fine", "Why are you worrying about the business model? Just design me a website!".

What actually happens in these cases is that they get a website, nothing happens, and everyone gets frustrated. 

What I suggest we do about this is: we email our list of 40-ish academics (from the surveymonkey!) with a brief explanation of the idea (breif because people don't read things properly if they're long), and a link to the *soundcloud*. If a sufficient amout of them are keen: wicked! If not, we need to reconsider. 

Think about it: if they don't want to contribute/don't have time at the moment, adding a nice website isn't going to make a difference. 

I believe this is the main problem to solve because: *no academics contributing = no product!*

#Then what do I suggest?


Firstly, I still think this route is a very good one to do because:

- The outcome can be awesome and is something that a lot of users really like (ex: ganymede podcast!). This is especially true if we get animation on top!
- some academics want to do outreach in this way (ex: Miguel, you said you much prefer writing to being interviewed).

***However, I suggest you guys seriously reconsider the interview format I mentioned last time***

Let's define plan A and B as follows:

- Plan A: Our current plan, namely academics write scripts and we produce them.
- Plan B: We interview academics and then provide a transcript of the interview. This would involve meeting them for a coffe for example in a park for example for an hour or so with a recorder. I would estimate you would need an hour sitting down for 10,15min of finished product. We would just buy them a coffee (free coffee for them! don't underestimate the power of a simple thing like that. It can be more powerful that "we might get you tutorees at some point" (ie: more work))

For me, the ideal solution is that we offer both options to academics and let them choose. I think this is what we should do from the start. There is no point to restrict the number of contributions we can get.

#Comparison of plan A and B:


##Ideal situation: what we expect of both plans

###Plan A:

- Academics are able to provide scripts regularly that we can work with and make awesome (edit, record etc...)


###Plan B:

- Academics are able to be interviewed, and the result is something we can work (edit)


##How the plans could fuck up 

###Plan A:

- Academics don't provide scripts regularly or at all because of some problem. Initially, these problems seems to be:
	-  lack of time (people seemed genuinly interested but are very busy)
	-  Don't know what to write about (a free subject can be daunting)
	-  they don't feel like they get something in return (essentially they have to write a report for free..). Even getting tutoring in return is still getting rewarded with more work :p

###Plan B:

- Academics don't want to be interviewed at all or regularly because of some problem. These problems could be:
	- Don't like to hear their own voice/be interviewed
	- don't have the time (**if this is the case then Plan A definately fails because of this problem**)
- We don't get enough academics due to geography (can't  access enough universities). Though is a scalabililty problem! (ie: a problem we'd be lucky to have). You generally shouldn't worry too much about a problem you'd be lucky to have :) (another example is "what if users find a way around share-to-keep??" answer: "I really hope that happens"). Anyways london has a lot of university (and has several world-leading uni, unlike any other city on earth..)


#The amount of work plan A and B require us to do
Firstly, it is important to recognise this this argument comes **after** the one about whether academics contribute. Again: **no academic contributions = no product!!**

Secondly, doing a lot work ourselves is **normal** (that's kind of the point of a startup). We should be making as easy as possible for the academics (it's not their startup! why should they be forced to go through a lot of trouble?). The point is rather having work that's manageable for us.

##Plan A:

- chasing up academics: the one's who are willing often seem to say 'call/email me again in 3 weeks as I'm really busy right now'. This can quickly become time-consuming and difficult to keep track of.
- Editing the scripts the academics give us (ex: we changed quite a bit of Mehdi's)
- Recording it (nailing style, pace) and editing breathing and stuff
- Music: it took ages to get good music for the Ganymede podcast; and problem of copyright! We haven't even found good music for the Tate.. (also, music divided a lot of users)

Obviously, we will get better at this. But in the case of music for example, this can really take ages. The thing is that we can't be flexible with small noises/glitches as this product is defined as something very slick (which is what it has going for it of course!)

##Plan B:

- Chasing up academics. Though it only requires setting a date to do it (which you can do in advance and then not think about). I think this is much easier to keep track of and you know exactly when you are getting a certain interview. Organising when we release podcasts become a lot easier. A problem would arise if they keep cancelling of course. However, similar argument as above: if they're flakey about meeting for an hour, then they'll definitely be flakey about writing a free topic essay.
- Research before interview. Don't know how much time this would take. However, we collectivly have a good broad understanding of academia. Personally, I meet academics very regularly for coffee and ask them questions without having looked up what they do online and I can still get some very interesting answers out of them. Obviously we would need more structure/format etc for interviews. But the point is that as our users don't have much knowledge of the subject area we shouldn't be asking questions that are too technical. You can end up having stock interview questions (which give a common structure to all the interviews) from which we can then follow the conversation where it goes. A good interviewer should be able to follow the speaker in a fluid way rather than mechanically run through your list of questions. It should informal/nice/fun for both parties: we don't need to be experts.
- Interviewing the academics (say, an hour meeting for 10,15min usable material +travel)
- Editing the completed interview. Don't know how long this would take. Depends on how good the raw audio is.. 
	- cons: might have to do a lot of editing (the academic can answert a question a second time they feel it wasn't good; though we do that already with plan A).
	- pros: Don't have to worry so much about things like breathing or even birds chirping etc.. (as an interview is expected to have side noises). This also depends on how we market the vibe of the interviews (if we present them as informal, then these things are ok!)


Obviously this is me making educated guesses about these things: we need to need to try it out to check!
#Benefits for the academic

##Plan A:

- Their research is presented really nicely and professionaly (music, audio, animation: a documentary).
- If they enjoy writing rather than speaking then this is a perfect platform

#Plan B:

- Academics get something very tangible in return: you meet them in person, they feel special (being interviewed), get a coffee, and a _nice conversation_ This can be more powerful than hope of futur tutoring (which is essentially more work..). An hour chat/interview in a park isn't really any effort (for those who enjoy that!)
- very low amount of work for them. They don't have to write a report/script (which can feel like work). A conversation with free coffee doesn't feel like work. It's also *guided*: we can decide with them on a subject within their discipline before hand but the fact that it's a conversation makes it a lot easier than writing a whole script from nothing.

Again, I still reallly like plan A (I say less about the pros of it because you already agree :) ) and I absolutely think we should push it because it can be really great.

#How to test whether plan A or B will work (or both)

##Plan A:

- Email our list of academics from survey with soundcloud link to Ganymede podcast. If they don't want to contribute/don't have the time to contribute, then *adding a website isn't going to change anything*. Their schedule isn't going to free up because of a website. Common fallacy about the internet: people thinking 'once I have a website it'll all work out'.
- If from our 40 emails we get a suitable number of replies (and actual scritps) then we're good to go!

##Plan B:

- Ask academics (especially those who said they had no time at the moment to write a script) for an interview. Prepare some interview questions before. Check that:
 	- you can actually get interviews.
	- The result is good/can be good (as with the written scripts, some of the interviews wouldn't be very good)
	- this will give us a feel for how difficult it is to do this and what the finished product is like.


#Summary

In summary, my main points are:

- it's going to be very difficult (maybe even not possible) to get enough regular contributions for the project to work
- therefore plan A shouldn't be our main source of content. Plan B will probably give a lot more output.
- users seem to like both A and B (about interviews/conversation: *most popular podcasts are in this form!!* So don't say: "users don't want this"). From talking to different people (yes, I know it's anecdotale), some people find the ganymede podcast boring and would prefer interviews. Also, some really like the ganymede podcast/that format.
- We should try out both plans: emails academics with soundcloud link, and try to get interviews. Trying out one plan doesn't stop trying the other! It would be silly to refuse to try something it!


Finally, once we agree on a path to take, we should set some concrete goals to hit for the next year.
