  By the time the Spanish flu pandemic was over in 1918, it had claimed an estimated
  50 million lives. Symptoms started like any ordinary flu, with a cough, chills
  and fever, but for many the symptoms could get so bad that they never recovered.
  Fluid would fill their lungs and they would struggle for air until they suffocated.
  Surprisingly, the victims were mainly young and healthy individuals as their prompt
  immune system overreacted to the infection, killing the person in an attempt to
  get rid of the virus.
</p>
<p>
  In 2005, scientists managed to sequence the RNA genome of the virus responsible
  for the Spanish flu, after it was isolated from the frozen corpse of a native
  Alaskan woman who had been buried for nearly eighty years in permafrost. They
  discovered that this 1918 flu strain was in fact a subtype of the avian flu virus.
</p>
<p>
  Many more epidemics have struck the world since 1918. Recently in 2004, we have
  seen the avian flu H5N1, swine flu H1N1 in 2007, and another avian flu H7N9 in
  2013. Each of these made the headlines, threatening to become the next, long-feared,
  global pandemic, but each one was also rapidly contained by quarantine measures
  on an international scale.
</p>
<p>
  Yet in 2003, a new virus reminded us that flu is not the only pathogen we should
  be wary of. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, spread to 29 countries
  in just a few months, killing nearly 10 percent of the people it infected, and
  costing billions of dollars to national economies. Since then, we have learnt
  of the great importance of acting rapidly and globally to contain the spread of
  infectious diseases.
</p>
<p>
  However, the recent epidemic of Ebola in West Africa has again shown our unpreparedness
  in the face of emerging infections, especially in terms of vaccines and antiviral
  drugs. Why, almost 100 years after the Spanish flu, are we still so unprepared
  and heavily reliant on containment rather than protective measures?
</p>
<p>
  The problem lies in the nature of the viruses themselves.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, viruses not only use our living cells to replicate, but once inside
  the cell, they also systematically divert every cellular activity towards the
  generation of more copies of the virus itself. The inextricable link now established
  between the virus and the cell makes it very hard for an anti-viral treatment (and
  even for our own immune systems!) to discriminate between the two, and thus to
  destroy the virus without harming the cell.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, viruses greatly differ in their composition, their target organs or
  cells, and their mechanism of infection. This makes it very difficult to identify
  common patterns that may help develop universal treatments. The vast majority of
  treatments developed so far are very virus-specific; they selectively target only
  specific viral components. For example, drugs developed against critical proteins
  of HIV wouldn’t work against other viruses. Our effort to keep up with the large
  diversity of known and unknown viruses comes at a huge financial cost, and
  likely won’t be rapid enough to be sufficiently effective.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we cannot predict when new viruses will emerge. The emergence of a new
  virus depends on a random combination of events that cause an existing virus,
  often infecting other animal species, to mutate in a very particular way that
  happens to overcome all of the biological barriers that would otherwise stop it
  from spreading to humans. At the same time, a rapid increase in world population,
  together with deforestation and uncontrolled urbanisation, have brought humans
  and animals in close enough contact to provide these mutated viruses the perfect
  environment to spread.
</p>
<p>
  And while viruses mutate and adapt quickly, introducing errors and alterations
  in their own genome, humans can’t. In front of a new virus rapidly spreading in
  our body, the immune system simply doesn’t have the time to evolve the correct
  tools to contain the virus without damaging the person. It often just fires all
  the most potent antiviral mechanisms, and these end up severely and irreversibly
  damaging our own cells. This was exactly the case for most of the largest
  epidemics on record, including the Spanish flu, SARS, and also for a number of
  viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever, like the dengue virus.
</p>
<p>
  It’s very hard to find a way to stop the unknown. We don’t know what a new virus
  will be like, and we don’t even know how our immune system will react to it. A
  deeper knowledge of the entire system, virus and cell, is required before we
  are able to develop effective countermeasures. Are there common mechanisms that
  some, or all pathogens share? Can we target these to fight different infections?
  Can we predict which viruses are more likely to emerge or re-emerge from the
  wild by studying the viruses currently infecting the animals we come into contact
  with? And can we learn how to tune our own immune system and the armoury of
  tools that our cells have evolved to keep pathogens away? The scientific tools
  now available, and the large amount of information that we have acquired so far,
  can help scientists advance their knowledge of infectious disease and develop
  new ways not only to contain, but also, and more importantly, to prevent and
  control infections.
</p>
<p>
  Our body doesn’t evolve at the same rate as viruses, but our scientific knowledge
  and progress do, and they are likely to be the most potent tools we have to free
  the world from pandemics.
