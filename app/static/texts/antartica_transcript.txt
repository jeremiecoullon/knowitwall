<p class = 'justify'>More than 2300 years ago, in a time when much of the world
  was unknown to Europeans, Greek philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that a substantial
  southern land mass in the southern hemisphere was necessary to balance the
  continents in the North. The idea of the imaginary land 'Antarctica' was so
  influential that 15th- to 17th-century maps commonly included a significant
  body of land across the southern hemisphere, based on no actual information! </p>
<p class = 'justify'> The first major piece of knowledge about Antarctica wasn’t
  formed until the late 18th century with the three circumnavigation voyages of
  Captain Cook. Specifically, his failure to discover Antarctica during his second
  voyage demonstrated that open ocean lay where maps had predicted Antarctic land.
  The proposed outline of Antarctica was thus pushed much further south, but
  it wasn’t ruled out. Finally, after centuries more of discovery and exploration,
  in 1895, a group of Norwegian explorers became the first to set foot on the
  Antarctic continent.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'>The International Geophysical Year, 1957, was the herald of
  a major phase of glaciological discovery, using geophysical techniques to measure
  the depth of the ice for the first time. Chief among these was seismic surveying.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'>Seismic surveying is a process where acoustic or sound waves
  emitted near the ice surface, usually in the form of a controlled explosion, are
  reflected off the base of the ice sheet and measured upon their return to the
  ice surface. As the velocity of sound in ice is known, the time taken between
  the explosion and the recording of the reflected waves can be converted to
  ice depth.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'> This method is very good for measuring ice thickness, but
  it has a big limitation: the amount of time needed to acquire a single point
  of data. To do the experiment, each seismic charge must be set in a borehole
  around 40 metres deep, next to another hole of similar depth where seismometers
  measure reflected waves. Drilling two holes and performing the experiment
  takes at least a day. A geophysical transect involving maybe 20 data points
  will need a full season of 2 to 3 months. Despite this, seismic profiling
  was used extensively in the International Geophysical Year, demonstrating
  that the continent was a single body of land, and that the ice was over 4000
  metres thick in some places. Still, there had to be a better way to collect data
  about ice thickness.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'> In the 1950s, Gordon Robin, an Australian physicist and
  long-term director of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, had
  perfected the art of seismic surveying on ice as part of his doctoral research.
  By using aircraft-mounted equipment to perform radio echo-sounding, rather than
  explosions conducted on the surface, Robin increased the rate of ice thickness
  data acquisition by at least five orders of magnitude, and was thus responsible
  for one of the 20th century’s major scientific breakthroughs. Between the late
  1960s and early 1980s, the technique was fine-tuned, and applied to measure approximately
  40% of the Antarctic Ice Sheet; a profound phase of discovery. Lakes were identified
  beneath the ice along with an appreciation of the sub-ice continental landscape,
  involving hitherto unknown mountains and valleys that testify to processes of change
  dating back many millions of years.

</p>
<p class = 'justify'>In more recent times, several programmes have unveiled over
  400 lakes beneath the ice, some of which leak their water to form ever-changing
  rivers flowing over hundreds of kilometres. They have also discovered mountains
  ranges, from which our comprehension of Antarctica’s role in the tectonic
  evolution of the planet has improved. And finally, these recent discovery missions
  have improved knowledge of the ice sheet at its boundary with the ocean – and
  this is where things get serious for us all.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'>The Antarctic Ice Sheet is known to be losing mass in several
  places. This is due to it melting because of relatively warm ocean water in
  contact with the grounded ice sheet. In such places the ice sheet rests on a bed
  several hundred metres below sea level, and slopes down, back toward the ice
  sheet centre. Thus, as the grounded part of the ice sheet retreats, it does so
  over an increasingly deeper bed, which accelerates the ice loss. This situation has
  led some scientists to believe that irreversible change in the Antarctic has
  already begun, with huge implications for global sea levels. Antarctica holds
  so much ice that, if melted, sea levels would rise by around 60 metres. The
  rate of sea level rise from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely to be no more
  than 1 metre per century, but such an increase would lead to the submerging of
  many low lying regions of the world by 2100.
</p>
<p class = 'justify'> Our knowledge of the Antarctic continent is a direct result
  of the exploration that precedes us. Yet, we still know little about so much of
  it. There are two places, for example, where one can stand on the Ice Sheet and
  be over 200 kilometres from a single point of data. Given the role Antarctica
  might be about to play in the history of this century, it does seem amazing that
  we know far more about the surfaces of the Moon and Mars than we do about the
  underside of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
