  The Large Hadron Collider (or LHC) lies in a 27 km-long circular tunnel on the
  Swiss-French border near Geneva. It was built to collide protons together, head-on,
  at the highest energies ever achieved. These collisions allow the LHC to function
  as the world’s most powerful microscope, probing the structure of matter at the
  tiniest distances, potentially looking inside fundamental particles like quarks
  and electrons – so far thought to not made up of even smaller particles – as
  well as potentially creating new particles, and discovering new forces between them.
</p>
<p>
  The biggest discovery at the LHC so far was a new particle known as the Higgs
  boson. This particle was first postulated by a group of six physicists in 1964
  who were trying to come up with a way of allowing fundamental particles to have
  mass. The answer they came up with was that the whole universe was permeated
  with a new quantum field, where the mass of a particle comes about via its
  interactions with this field.
</p>
<p>
  This worked from a mathematical point of view, but it is a big leap to propose
  that such a quantum field really exists just based on theory. Some experimental
  evidence was required. The only direct way of obtaining such evidence would be
  to hit this background field of the universe so hard that a ripple – a quantum
  excitation – is created in the field. This would manifest itself as a new
  particle: the Higgs boson. This is one of the things the LHC was designed to do,
  and in 2012, the new Higgs boson particle was discovered.
</p>
<p>
  The two experiments involved, ATLAS and CMS, are now in the process of trying
  to measure as much about this boson as they can. So far, everything we know
  about it is consistent with it being the same Higgs boson as proposed in the
  Standard Model of particle physics. This is evidence that we really do understand
  the origin of the masses of fundamental particles, and evidence that the Standard
  Model of particle physics is valid up to much higher energies than many physicists
  might have expected.

</p>
<p>
  The Higgs boson discovery was made under intense pressure: pressure of competition
  between ATLAS and CMS, and, at least initially, with the Tevatron experiments in
  the USA. Everyone was very excited, the media were following every twist and turn,
  and public interest was high. Let's focus on two animations, made by the ATLAS
  collaboration. Here’s the first one:
</p>

<figure class="figure_transcript">

  <figcaption >  Animation 1: Mass distribution from photon-pair events (ATLAS experiment) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To make this distribution, we collect proton-proton collisions and look for pairs
  of isolated high-energy photons resulting from the collisions. Photons are quanta
  of light, but the ones measured here are about ten billion times more energetic
  than photons of visible light.
</p>
<p>
  Once we have two photons and their measured energies, we hypothesize that they
  were the result of the decay of some particle produced in the collision. We then
  combine their momenta to work out what the mass of that particle might be. In
  most cases, the hypothesis is false, and we see a smoothly falling distribution
  of masses. If there were a new particle in there, there would be an excess of
  pairs of photons at a mass corresponding to the mass of the new particle. In the
  animation, mass is on the x-axis, and the number of pairs of photons created is
  on the y-axis.
</p>
<p>
  As you watch the animation, you can see that, over time, more and more photon
  pairs are collected. There are fake “bumps” in the distribution everywhere, but
  these are statistically insignificant. That's when you have to keep calm and
  carry on with the experiment, despite the tension. You collect more data. In the
  meantime, you try all kinds of tricks to make sure you are measuring the mass of
  the photon pairs correctly – you calibrate the detector. How sure are you of
  where on the horizontal axis a given photon pair should appear?
</p>
<p>
  Watch the distribution. Eventually it gets smoother, all except for a glitch
  around 125 GeV, which gets more and more significant until in the end there is
  a clear bump – this is the sign of a new particle.
</p>
<p>
  In parallel, the other major distribution currently being shown in Animation 2
  is the mass distribution for “four-lepton” events.

<p>
  “Four leptons” means that, resulting from the collision, there were two electron-positron
  pairs or two muon-antimuon pairs, or one of each pair. If you combine the
  momenta of these four leptons to get a mass, you can search for a new particle.
  These events are very rare, whether or not a Higgs boson is created. It is a
  different kind of exercise in statistics and in patience watching this distribution
  build up. There are two expected peaks: one from the Z boson (which carries the
  weak nuclear force and has a mass of 90 GeV) and one from the threshold at which a
  pair of Z bosons can be made (starting at about twice the Z mass – 180 GeV).
  However, as we see the distribution build up, a peak in between the Z bosons
  begins to form. This is, again, the sign of a new particle: the Higgs boson.
