<p class = 'audiodoc_abstract-bio justify'>Susannah is a Junior Research Fellow at Imperial College London,
  where she uses geology to examine patterns of dinosaur diversity. When not
  fiddling about with stegosaurs, she spends her time taming a toddler and mountain
  biking, with variable success in each case, and not necessarily at the same time.
