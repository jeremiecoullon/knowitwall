    Our atmosphere is dirty. I’m not talking about greenhouse gases – those are a
    story for another day. I’m talking about tiny particles, just a few microns
    in size, known as aerosols. They’re so small that you can’t see them, but the
    evidence is everywhere: from the black residue when you blow your nose after
    spending the day in a busy city, to the hazy sky on a warm summer’s day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most abundant aerosol is mineral dust, tiny particles of sand and other
    surface materials, picked up by winds as they blow across the world’s desert
    regions.  Dust. It might seem insignificant, benign. In fact, it could be
    responsible for the survival of the Amazon rainforest as we know it today.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sahara is the source of about half the mineral dust in the atmosphere,
    emitting on average over a hundred million tonnes per year. Some 50% of this
    dust comes from one single spot, in the southwest corner of Chad, called the
    Bodélé Depression. This depression – a topographic low in the surrounding
    landscape – is part of a vast dry lake bed. As recently as 6000 years ago,
    the whole area was submerged beneath the surface of Lake Mega Chad. Less a
    lake and more an inland sea, Lake Mega Chad was once larger than all of North
    America’s Great Lakes combined. As the world’s climate changed, the Sahara
    dried out and the receding waters left behind an abundant supply of fine
    sediment particles, just waiting to be entrained by the wind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many parts of the Sahara, and indeed other desert regions around the world,
    share a similar history to this. There are two things, however, that make the
    Bodélé Depression unique and explain why it produces such a vast amount of
    dust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firstly, the surface is covered in skeletons of microscopic creatures called
    “diatoms”, which reside in water bodies. Known as “diatomite”, this material
    is extremely light for its size, its density roughly half that of typical
    desert sand. It is therefore much more readily picked up by the wind than,
    relatively, much heavier sand particles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the Bodélé lies directly downwind of two Saharan mountain ranges –
    the Tibesti and the Ennedi. These mountains not only channel the prevailing
    northeasterly wind directly onto the exposed diatomite surface, but this
    channelling effect also accelerates the surface wind, ensuring that it is
    strong enough to entrain the surface material.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dust emission from the Bodélé Depression can therefore be thought of as an
    intricate coincidence, a conspiracy of geology and climatology. And the coincidences
    don’t end there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because mineral dust particles are so small and light, once they are lifted
    from the desert surface they can drift in the wind for weeks at a time. Dust
    from the Bodélé usually finds its way into a river of air that blows towards
    the west, across the Sahara and out over the Atlantic. On this journey, the
    dust plays games with the atmosphere. For example, clouds of dust will reflect
    and absorb radiation from the sun. One effect this can have is to reduce
    surface temperatures beneath the dust cloud during the day, with drops in
    temperature of over 10&deg;C not uncommon during extremely big dust outbreaks.
    Although such extreme effects are short-lived and localised, mineral dust
    actually has a cooling effect on <i>global</i> climate – albeit a very weak one in
    comparison to the warming caused by humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean lies the Amazon rainforest. Although
    a highly productive and lush ecosystem, the soils of the Amazon are naturally
    quite infertile, with vast amounts of nutrients being washed away by floodwaters
    each year. Without input from some other source, Amazon fertility would decrease,
    damaging regional ecosystems as well as a valuable carbon sink. Where do these
    nutrients come from? Amazingly, it turns out that at certain times of the
    year, the Amazon finds itself directly in the path of mineral dust from the
    Bodélé Depression, 3000 miles away! This is the mystery source of fertiliser.
    Compared to regular desert sand, diatomite is turbo-charged with iron and
    phosphorous, two essential plant nutrients. In an average year, 20 million
    tonnes of Saharan dust is dumped on the Amazon basin, quite literally washed
    out of the sky by rain. Around 20,000 tonnes of this is phosphorous – the
    same amount that is washed out of the Amazon basin by floodwaters each year.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, dust. Seemingly doing little more than muddying our air, fertilisation of
    the Amazon by dust from the Bodélé Depression represents just one of the many
    complex and beautiful relationships that exist within the Earth system.
    However, this relationship is also extremely fragile. It would take just a
    minor shift in climate to disrupt this conveyor belt of nutrients from the
    Bodélé Depression to the Amazon, threatening the health of the rainforest and
    the important place it holds in the Earth system.
