    "topic_description": "Humans have increased the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere; that, at least, everyone agrees on. What is less widely acknowledged are the many ways that CO<sub>2</sub> affects our planet. From acidifying oceans destroying coral reefs to \"heat stress\" in plants causing drought (and don't forget global warming), the global carbon cycle is worth understanding.",
