Olalla Castro-Alvaredo is a Senior Lecturer at City, University of London. She is an expert in integrable quantum field theory: a physical theory that describes quantum interactions between large sets of elementary particles in one space dimension. In recent years she has worked on the development of measures of entanglement for these theories. It is expected that a better understanding of such measures may have applications in the areas of quantum information and computation.
