Davide is a scientist at King’s College London and leads the HipSci Cell Phenotyping group at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine. He is interested in microscopic images of stem cells — not just because they look nice, but also because he enjoys making biological sense out of them and translating this into medical therapies.
