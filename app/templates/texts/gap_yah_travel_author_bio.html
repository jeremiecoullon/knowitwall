Emma has recently completed a PhD in French Literature at UCL. Her research looks at French travel in Europe in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She is currently working on a volume entitled <i>The English Barbarian</i> which explores this further in the example of travel to England. Away from the printed and manuscript travelogue, she enjoys classical singing.
