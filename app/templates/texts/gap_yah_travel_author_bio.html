Emma is a postdoctoral researcher in French history and literature. Her research looks at French travel in Europe in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She is currently working on a volume entitled ‘The English Barbarian’ which explores this further in the example of travel to England. Away from the printed and manuscript travelogue, she enjoys classical singing.
