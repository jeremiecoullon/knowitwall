#design plan for audiodocs in website

##2 audiodocs in total

- have 2 audiodocs in the same section style as when it was only 1. 
	1. have the most recent one before the 'about' section, and the other one after
	2. have both after the 'about' section

##3 audiodocs in total

- 3 audiodocs styled in the same/similar way (all on the main page)
	1. most recent one above the 'about section', 2 older ones after.
	2. (OR) have all 3 after the 'about' section
- the 3 audiodocs are presented in the home page in a 'slim' manner:
	1. you then click on them and open up the whole audiodoc & transcript & other in a seperate page.
	2. (OR) click on an audiodoc to reveal the whole audiodoc.


	
	
##4+ audiodocs in total

- first 3 audiodocs on main page (like above), then go to 'for more audiodocs' to get a list of all audiodocs
	- the list could be a 'slim' version of them: click to open an audiodoc in a whole seperate page or unravel.
