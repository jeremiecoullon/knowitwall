 Knowitwall
==========
*Know it Wall (KiW) is a newly founded public engagement website, based at UCL, that aims to popularise research across all disciplines, from arts to sciences.
KiW takes 1,000-word scripts that academics write on research worth sharing with the wider public and turns these into short audio-documentaries (less than 10 minutes long). Once produced, both audio-documentaries and scripts are published on KiW’s website –knowitwall.com – as well as on iTunes, Soundcloud and Medium.*


To get Knowitwall running locally:

- install packages in `requirements.txt`
- run `run.py`


####Annotations

Annotating the documentaries is in development on the `userloginOAuth` branch (there's some documentation on that branch)
