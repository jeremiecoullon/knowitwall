Knowitwall
==========
Know it Wall (KiW) is a newly founded public engagement website, based at UCL, that aims to popularise research across all disciplines from arts to sciences.
KiW takes 1,000-word scripts that academics write on research worth sharing with the wider public and turns these into short audio-documentaries (less than 10 minutes long). Once produced, both audio-documentaries and scripts are published on KiW’s website – [knowitwall.com](http://knowitwall.com/) – as well as on iTunes, Soundcloud and Medium.

The overarching aim is use these documentaries as a starting point for interactive storytelling.
