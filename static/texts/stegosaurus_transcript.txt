  <p class = 'justify'> Hands up who knows what <i>Stegosaurus</i> is? Pretty much every 7
    year old in the world can tell you that <i>Stegosaurus</i> was a plant-eating
    dinosaur which walked on four legs, and possessed two rows of bony plates and spines that
    extended down its back from its neck right to the end of its tail. But what fewer
    people know is that, despite being one of the most iconic dinosaurs, stegosaur
    fossils are actually really rare – and that causes lots of problems if we want
    to understand how they lived, and what they were doing with those bony plates
    and spines. </p>
  <p class="jusify">Stegosaurs are bird-hipped dinosaurs, which means they are
    closely related to dinosaurs like <i>Ankylosaurus</i>, <i>Iguanodon</i> and <i>Triceratops</i>,
    but more distantly related to the lizard-hipped dinosaurs, which included the
    long-necked dinosaurs, things like <i>Diplodocus</i>, the meat-eating dinosaurs, such
    as <i>T. rex</i>, and of course the birds, which are the direct descendants of the
    dinosaurs.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    Stegosaurs lived in a time period called <i>the Late Jurassic</i>, from about 165 to
    145 million years ago. The first dinosaurs evolved about 235 million years ago,
    and the last dinosaurs – if we exclude the birds – went extinct at the end
    of the Cretaceous, 66 million years ago. That means the dinosaurs ruled the
    Earth for 170 million years! But that’s not all: it also means that <i>Stegosaurus</i>
    was already a fossil by the end of the Cretaceous when <i>T. rex</i> was alive,
    and that <i>T. rex</i> is closer to us in time than it was to <i>Stegosaurus</i>. Stegosaur
    fossils have been found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica,
    suggesting that, while they may have been rare, they were widespread.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    So that’s some of the things the fossil record tells us about the stegosaurs.
    But what was the function of the two rows of bony plates and spines on their
    backs? What were they <i>for</i>? Understanding what the plates and spines were
    for could help us to understand a lot more about the lives of these animals
    – whether they were warm blooded or cold blooded, whether they were social
     animals or lived individually. A few leading theories have thus been suggested.
  </p>
  <p class="justify"> One theory is that the rows of plates and spines were for
    defence. Any large, meat-eating dinosaur attacking from above would receive
    a mouthful of spikes if it tried to attack a stegosaur. And the spikes at the
    end of the stegosaur’s tail could be swung to impale the leg of any predator
    daring enough to get too close.
  </p>
  
  <p class="justify"> What does the fossil record say about this? Well, there is
    a vertebra – a bone from the back – of the meat-eating dinosaur <i>Allosaurus</i>,
    likely <i>Stegosaurus’</i> most fearsome predator. The vertebra has been punctured,
    and the bone has healed in a ring. Insert a <i>Stegosaurus</i> tail spike into the
    ring and it fits perfectly, perhaps suggesting the injury was inflicted by the
    back end of an angry stegosaur. Researchers have also calculated that the force
    at the end of a swinging stegosaur tail spike could impact into bone. But what
    of the plates on the back? These are much thinner, and it seems unlikely
    they could have withstood the force of an <i>Allosaurus</i> bite: for <i>Allosaurus</i>,
    munching on a <i>Stegosaurus</i> plate would probably have been like eating a pack
    of Pringles!
  </p>
  <p class="justify"> So what could explain why the plates of <i>Stegosaurus</i> evolved?
    According to another theory, they evolved to control body temperature. The
    dinosaurs were probably cold-blooded, so would have had to rely on some aspects
    of their environment to regulate their body temperature. The plates of
    <i>Stegosaurus</i> are very broad and thin. They are covered in blood vessel pits,
    suggesting the animal could have pumped blood into the plates, perhaps allowing
    it to cool down.
  </p>
  <p class="justify"> However, the plates of other stegosaurs, such as <i>Kentrosaurus</i>
    from <i>Tanzania</i>, or <i>Chungkingosaurus</i> from China, are much smaller than those of
    <i>Stegosaurus</i>, and they probably weren’t large enough to act as heat radiators.
    <i>Stegosaurus</i> might have used its plates to help it cool down, but it doesn’t seem
    like that’s why they evolved. It looks like we are running out of options…
  </p>
  <p class="justify"> But are we really? The final leading theory that has been
    suggested is that the plates and spikes were simply display structures: they
    were used to identify members of the same species, to make sure the animal was
    mating with its own kind, or perhaps they just made the stegosaur look larger
    and more fearsome than it actually was. Stegosaurs probably weren’t winning
    any running races, so they needed another way to deter predators. All of the
    different species of stegosaurs had different shaped plates and spikes,
    lending some credence to this theory.
  </p>
  <p class="justify"> It seems likely that all three of these theories might be
    right in one way or another. While stegosaur plates might not have been any
    good for defence, stegosaur tail spikes were probably fearsome weapons. <i>Stegosaurus</i>
    might have used its plates as heat radiators, even if they weren’t so
    useful for this in other stegosaurs. And they probably all used their plates
    to make them look larger or to attract the right mate. In the end, if we
    are to understand more about these fascinating, iconic animals, our search
    for more stegosaur fossils, especially ones that represent complete skeletons,
    cannot stop here: we need to keep digging deep.
