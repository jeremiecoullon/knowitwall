#My web design rant and what it means for Knowitwall

##standard 'boxes'

Here are some examples of standard boxes in websites. I like them, but I want to avoid these as they've become really cliché.Note that my opinions here aren't about UX; all these sites are great to use and look good as well.

- [colored boxes](http://jonathanpatterson.com/): the colours are cool, and from memory they're very similar to Jon's design for his site. These kind of boxes are super cliché though
- [scrolly site](http://weareadaptable.com/): scolling, boxes etc..
- [boxesss](http://coullon.com/): This is actually my sister's site here (don't tell her! :p). These kinds of boxes were all the rage a few years ago so they pop up everywhere.
- [moar boxes](http://www.wix.com/sample/website-viewer?lng=en&site_id=1379239176129578): ... moving right along
- [boxboxbox](http://blog.choosic.co/): This is Choosic's blog. moar boxes. Also, the scrolling (left and right) is really unintuitive; it's a good rule of thumb to follow physics: how would you expect a piece of paper to move in real life if you pushed it to the right or left ? Another thing about this is the ridiculously slow page loading time (if the site isn't saved in cache)
- [some shitty band](http://dajdook.com/): wow what a cliché looking site dunno who designed this piece of shit. The reason this site looks like every other site on the planet is that a lot of people use this kind of [template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)
- [another shit site](http://knowitwall.com/): I think you're starting to appreciate why I'm sick of boxes.
- [slightly better boxes](https://medium.com/know-it-wall): So this is still loads of boxes, but at least it's not symmetrical. I think this already improved on perfectly equal squares all the time

##beyond standard shit

The past 5-10 years in web design have generally been about _flat design_: loosely this means clean & minimal pages, with do '3D' element to them. For example, no shadows on stuff (like boxes!) to make stuff look 3D: everything looks 2D. This was a reaction to the horrors we'd all seen in the 90s (think Myspace and terrible flash animations).

But now that we've all calmed down and appreciate the use of space (and boxes), things are starting to move back to 3D looking things, interactive sites, and generally things that look a bit more 'real' (like putting a shadow effect on boxes..)

So here are some sites that I like and either seem to be going in this direction, or are generally really good (or sometimes simply don't put loads of boxes everywhere)

- [this one is awesome](http://yourlocalstudio.dk/): so it's still boxes, but the fact that they aren't all the same size and space out randomly is great. It's actually still a 'wall' in a way, but not all the 'bricks' are clickable. I think this would be really cool for knowitwall (without the initial animation), maybe just to present the first 10 or so episodes (and then the other episodes are on a separate page that also presented in this way). This is still flat design, but done in a really cool way.
- [an interactive one](http://airnauts.com/): So this one is super interactive (and is probably a beast to code up), and is generally cool. Another thing I like about it is the slanted line (during the interactive bit) that moves around. So even if it's not interactive (for example when you land on the site and you don't scroll down) the page is cut into 2 non-symmetric parts. So it's like boxes, just not so goddam square. That could be a fairly simple way to move away from boring boxes. Mixing this with the Medium style boxes (in the previous section) would be good, and would still look like bricks in a way. Think about [dry stone walls](https://www.google.ae/search?q=dry+stone+wall&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=778&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFgP3Nxt7LAhVtb5oKHed9C2cQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=DXPprADKCJ7tiM%3A): they aren't all the same shape & size.
- [networkz](http://www.wix.com/sample/website-viewer?lng=en&site_id=1428218474096549): a cool way to display the different bits on the site. I don't really want this for knowitwall but at least it's not boring
- [nice boxes](http://www.thisisnowexhibition.com/): this is a 'standard' scrolly design, but is really nice (it's for an exhibition of design so you'd expect it to be good...)
- [diagonal lines](http://carterdigital.com.au/): so ignore the fucking boxes as you scroll down and focus on the red diagonal lines on the landing image. Those 2 thin red lines make that landing page feel a bit less 'square' surprisingly well. I think Jon's site had that in the background as well (it was a 'scrolly site' like the example site directly above, but had wacky colours; also, each section had a diagonal grid of thin lines overlaying it (a different direction for each section) which also made it look less 'blocky')
- [more nice scrolly stuff](http://junduffy.co.nz/): the 'HEY' at the beginning is quirky, and the way they present their clothes as you scroll down is cool. The nav bar is super discrete (though maybe a bit too much; I didn't even see it for a while..)
- [cool landing page](http://www.anabeckerdesign.com/ana/): just for the landing page: it's still 2 equal squares, but the fact that they are linked is clever (the left one corresponds to her data visualization job, and the right one is about her band).
- [still boxes, but good](http://nrly.co/): it's still boxes all over the place, but it's cool
