#contacting pint of science researchers

##overview
- Each venue has 3 days of talks. Venues have between 1 and 4 talks (but usually 2 talks) per day.
- Each person has to take care of 6 or 7 venues. This means: contact all the academics who gave a talk at those venues during the 3 days.
- The links below are each for a different venue _on the Monday_. That means that **you must also go on the Tuesday & Wednesday** links and invite the speakers on those days (links for those days at the bottom of the page when you open the URL)
- Whether a set of venues has 6 or 7 venues depended on whether there were many talks: sets with 7 venue got the ones with fewer talks. So it balances out.
- The assignment of each of us to their set of venues was done randomly, using Python's excellent random number generator (`numpy.random.randint()`)
- However, those of us at Imperial have speakers from Imperial, and those from UCL have speakers from UCL (and also University of London unis) (some switching around did occur to make this happen..)

##Emailing logistics

_Constraints:_

To further complicate things (cuz yolo) we need to satisfy the following constraints:

1. Jeremie doesn't deal with replies (needs to codez)
2. Miguel doesn't send out any initial emails (he's dealing with emails for the Festival of the Arts already and academics in general)
3. Angus doesn't send initial emails from his email account. The reason is that we've noticed a huge difference in replies between his emails and Miguel's emails even though they follow the same template. It seems that saying that you're a phd student is more convincing that saying you graduated last year.. :(
4. I think it's fine if Peter and Vidish send initial emails, as long as they say that they're starting a PhD in physics & MSc in science media production respectively (street cred)


_Solution:_

- Vidish and Peter send out the emails to their assigned academics, and deal with the replies
- Jeremie sends out emails to his assigned academics. If/when they reply, he emails back with Angus CCed saying something like "glad you're interested; my colleague will explain in more detail lalala". So Angus then deals with the replies.
- Angus writes the emails to his assigned academics but in the 'Miguel' template (ie: "I'm Miguel, a PhD student, and boy do I love philosophy"). He then sends them to Miguel (so the emails already written with the email addresses of the academics) who sends them from his inbox. Miguel deals with those replies.

##Deadline

Pint of Science lasts 3 nights: from Monday 23rd to Wednesday 25th (there's also 1 talk on Thursday).

- Sending out emails the day after their talk might be a bit overwhelming for the speakers (they might be hungover).
- However we also want their talks to be fresh in their minds

_Deadline:_

So maybe we can send the emails on the weekend of the 28th. Ie: Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.
Not Friday (because end of the week --> tired). Though maybe Monday isn't great as it's back to work ? Thoughts ?
In any case, let's set a deadline (for example Monday) to have sent all our emails.

##template

We need to figure out a template.

- No need to personalise the email to each academic (too much work) so we just need to fill in the name of their talk.
- We can also phrase in the same way that Miguel has been doing for the Festival of the Arts. Namely, say something like: "you gave a talk on \<lalala\>; you probably have notes for it. Could you send us those notes?". It makes it much easier for them to be willing to contribute (rather than sending them our 'guidelines for academics'), and once they answer we can deal with the structure/editing (namely: they might write up their notes properly before sending it)
