# Knowitwall: viewed from different angles

## between ted-ed and curiosity: outreach (dissemination)

- pyramid: from memes --> audio-doc --> documentary, articles --> online courses --> tutoring

(See plan with pyramid for more detail)

## genius for academic subjects: user generated content

*who does annotating/user generated content? how do they do it? difficulties? things they don't do (that they should)*

###competitors: 

- wikipedia
- Genius (annotations)
- Beneath the Ink (annotations)
- Quora: Q&A
- facebook
- StackOverflow (coding help) and variants (Mathoverflow, other disciplines)
- Reddit
- Hackernews

**Task: How do you moderate the community to attain a specific objective?**

## research project: mapping academic disciplines

*_Research Aim:_ To create a 'map of knowledge'/'Wall of Knowledge': topics within disciplines with links between them.  The general public anotate short documentaries with relevant references*

- start off with a 5 min documentaries of specific topics within academic disciplines (written by academics)
- the academic who wrote it provides a few online recommendations (in the text/audio)
- the public annotates as well providing relevant recommendations
- recommendations include: documentaries, books, articles, podcasts, other Knowitwall docuemntaries, courses...
- recommendations are classified by time investment, level of expertise, and topic (you put a short sentence describing the recommendation)
- The recommendations from all the audio-docs are grouped together and visualised to provide a 'Wall of Knowledge'.

Need a quick literature review: network analysis of platforms like Twitter/facebook/wikipedia. What has previous research learnt about the links that people make between different subjects?
