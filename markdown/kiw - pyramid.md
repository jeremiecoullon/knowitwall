##short term plan

###feedback

- transcript: not obvious button. 'Read the transcript'
- transcript highlighted as the audio reads it, or automatic scrolling
- content higher up.

##audiodocs

- use mehdi's text
- 'milk' friends: get 4 or so audiodocs, events. then got more by spamming
strategy for AD contributors:
	- events (Pint of Science)
	- poaching outreach magazine (ex the wormhole article)
	- friends
	- getting to know people at UCL who do outreach
	- asking to reproduce a text from any outreach magazine/blog etc...

##to do:

- terms and conditions. who owns what? rights legal stuff
--> UCL advances: advice on legal stuff.
- trademark
- website: contribute section
- website contribute section doesn't appear
- contribute section: "...we're not interested in. The process is simple: you send the text, we do the rest."
- newsletter right now before having facebook page to tell people about update. **ask Beatrice**
- survey: somehow having a survey on the site. We want the website to give feedback.
- UX: survey? read transcript: having this more obvious?
- be able to find it on google
- recording places: find out with public engagement people at UCL
###funding:

- video stuff
- trademark stuff?
- equiment?
- marketing?
- registering company: when does this happen? how?
