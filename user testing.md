Task                  | Response
:--------------------:|:-----------:
[At index] don't click anything; first impression?|  it's about space/planets (you see a picture of a planet an a big 'Oceans on Ganymede' title). Want to either click on 'about' in nav bar, or the player. The photo of Ganymede looks a bit like it's our logo.
Click on something  | clicked on 'About'
What is this about? | Its actually not only about planets, it's about any academic subject. Corresponds to short documentaries (maybe 15-30min). It's very academic, and is like a sumary of a lecture. The 'pub chat' part is engaging, but doesn't relate to the rest (as pub chats often aren't serious or rigorous in any way.
Do something else  | Click on 'podcasts'. The Ganymede one isn't there anymore; it's now more unrelated podcasts.

###Things to do:

- The first section of the index doesn't say what it is about. Need a catch phrase, smaller 'Ganymede' title, and maybe a text box: 'newest audio-doc', so it's obvious that the podcast is simply the recent one and not the whole story. Also a short description of the podcast as well (one line).

[at index] don't click; first impressions? | _likes:_ colour (good for having pictures on top), the font, the simplicity (a lot of sites have a lot of crap on it), it feels very modern. _Would suggest:_ a block/border around the name & maybe bigger (to make it more prominent). _her thoughts:_ She thinks the nav bar links are different pages (so need signposting & smooth scroll). She thinks the tagline is to do with the Ganymede podcast, rather than the site in general. Also, prefers The Knowitwall for the top left title, but knowitwall everywhere else. Verbally saying 'The Knowitwall'. 'Knowitwall' can be the company name but 'The knowitwall' is the actual wall (site) with the podcasts.
Now do something | She scrolls down manually to see what's going on below before clicking on nav bar links. (then she realises that the nar bar links redirect you down the page).

###Things to do:

-  smooth scrool (to make it obvious that you're on the same page!)
-  signposting in nav bar (ie: the current tab is highlighted; this shows you where you are)

###Her suggestions/thoughts:

- I asked what she thought if it was 'audio-doc' rather than 'podcast': confused about what that would mean. People know what 'podcast' means.
- 'released into the wild': this got a chuckles (getting a laugh is good :) )
- Saying explicity 'you must have a phd to contribute' sounds douchy. (So I then wrote it more implicitly)
- She suggested as a catchphrase: 'Experts unplugged: podcasts from academic researchers'
- keep thinks as simple as possible (ex: audio-documentary. complicates things unnecessarily)
- She suggests title as 'The Knowit Wall'. Elsewhere write 'knowitwall' or 'knowit wall' but might pronounce it 'the knowit wall' (I agree with this)
