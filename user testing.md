Task                  | Response
:--------------------:|:-----------:
[At index] don't click anything; first impression?|  it's about space/planets (you see a picture of a planet an a big 'Oceans on Ganymede' title). Want to either click on 'about' in nav bar, or the player. The photo of Ganymede looks a bit like it's our logo.
Click on something  | clicked on 'About'
What is this about? | Its actually not only about planets, it's about any academic subject. Corresponds to short documentaries (maybe 15-30min). It's very academic, and is like a sumary of a lecture. The 'pub chat' part is engaging, but doesn't relate to the rest (as pub chats often aren't serious or rigorous in any way.
Do something else  | Click on 'podcasts'. The Ganymede one isn't there anymore; it's now more unrelated podcasts.

###Things to do:

- The first section of the index doesn't say what it is about. Need a catch phrase, smaller 'Ganymede' title, and maybe a text box: 'newest audio-doc', so it's obvious that the podcast is simply the recent one and not the whole story. Also a short description of the podcast as well (one line).
